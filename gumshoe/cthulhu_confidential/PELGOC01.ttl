It described the perfect utopia of the year 2000. At the last minute, Bradbury took an inexplicable shine to Hunt’s inexperienced draftsman George Wyman and asked him to take the lead on the project. An uncertain Wyman affixed a pencil to an Ouija planchette and consulted his dead brother, who wrote a note urging him to accept the assignment. The building was then constructed in gorgeous Renaissance revival style, though its beauty cost Bradbury his very life force — he dropped dead before its completion. A monument to Euclidean order, it helps to counter and drain the insane energies of the Mythos gods who have taken up increasing residence in the minds of city inhabitants. By the late 30s, frayed around the edges, the building is mostly occupied by fabric wholesalers." ;

His preservationist ally Christine Sterling now puts the finishing touches on a beautifying project called China City, which will open next year. It surrounds the Chinese community with a picturesque, tourist-friendly wall. What goes better together than China and walls? In a spirit of clever parsimony, parts of the wall incorporate leftover set pieces from the movie The Good Earth, featuring such celebrated Chinese actors as Paul Muni and Louise Rainier. The fact that this dampens the powers of the community’s virtuous red magicians must be a coincidence. Right, Mister Chandler?" ;

On the advice of ley-obsessed Harry Chandler, zoning rules prohibit any other building from exceeding its height. Architects modeled its neoclassical lines on the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, built in honor of the 4th Century BCE Hellenistic Persian satrap Mausolus by his sister and widow Artemesia. The two rulers built their city from nearly nothing and absorbed vast quantities of wealth in doing so. Such was the splendor of Artemesia’s structure that her husband-brother became the namesake for monuments to the dead. By sympathetically evoking their spirits, City Hall grants its occupants subliminal occult power to arrogate resources from the citizenry and win approval for their development projects. It shares this influence with the chief Masonic temple in the nation’s capital." ;

As a side effect of City Hall’s resonance, sensitive, withdrawn women across the city sometimes dream of panthers, or even come to believe that they are transforming into big cats. City Hall’s magical emanations may also be responsible for the city’s statistically anomalous incidence of brother-sister incest cases." .

Six years later, in a paranoid, drunken rage, Griffith shot Christina in the head, costing her the use of her right eye. After a divorce and brief stint in San Quentin, Griffith made a second Christmas present to the city: funds to build a Greek theater in the park.
Griffith died in 1919, leaving behind a will calling for the construction of an observatory to bring astronomical knowledge to the urban masses. The Griffith Observatory opened four years ago, in 1933. Visitors most remark upon its prominently displayed, deco-styled Foucault’s pendulum, a device demonstrating the Earth’s rotation.
Legend attributes a rash of misfortunes and untimely deaths in the park to Doña Petrenilla, a ghostly young woman in a white 19th-century dress who patrols it on misty nights. She’s been sore ever since, in true Los Angeles fashion, someone cheated her out of this land in an inheritance grift. Some say that when Griffith J. Griffith shot his wife, he thought he was aiming at Petrenilla.
A beacon shines from a tower in the park. At night, should he find himself groggily returning to consciousness in the northern part of the city sprawl, your Investigator can use its light to orient himself.
Sightings of green, man-like beings in the park suggest it also contains an outlet for a subterranean ghoul corridor.""" ;

His bestselling book Unveiled Mysteries tells of his meeting on California’s Mount Shasta with the freshly materialized immortal mystic Saint-Germain. The way he tells it, Saint-Germain fed him a wafer of pure electronic essence, taking him on an astral tour of the world. The count taught him that truth of the universal godhead within us all can be learned from god-like Ascended Masters who transcend life and death.

Hughes and his passenger said he was sober and driving slowly, and that the man walked in front of him. A witness said otherwise, but completely reversed the story in time for the coroner’s inquest.

In a turn that will not surprise anyone who has read this far, the restoration of Hispanic history entailed the wholesale displacement of its current immigrant residents. Chandler, eager to get his geomantic fingerprints all over this numinous region of the city, supported the plan at a crucial moment by picking up the phone to Police Chief Two Gun Davis. He rounded up the prison labor necessary to fix up a key structure, the 1818 Avila Adobe, saving it from condemnation and getting his foot in the redevelopment door. That was in 1930. The preservationists got their tourist trap Mexican-themed marketplace, Chandler hooked it into his ley-line grid, and residents had to find new homes in the Chavez Ravine. Noticing a Chinese neighborhood across the street, Chandler fretted that its geomancers would use feng shui techniques to divert his hard-won ley force, so he, Sterling, and Chandler decided to put a train station there. In 1937, Union Station is still a construction site; it will open in ’39." ;
