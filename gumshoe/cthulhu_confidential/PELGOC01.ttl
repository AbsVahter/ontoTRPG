The kindly, tweed-clad woman who taught her Natural Science course managed to make the subjects interesting but didn’t woo her into the sciences. Viv had nearly forgotten her until she found herself in need of scientific assistance in one of her investigations. Viv admires Nettie’s energy — as the new chair of the Department of Natural Sciences at Hunter College, she’s always buried in paperwork, yet she always manages to teach the introductory classes and spend time meeting with students. The constant activity takes a toll, though, and there’s no secret to the source of her energy: empty coffee cans litter Nettie’s office and apartment. Viv may notice her friend’s hands shaking from over-caffeination, or Nettie may suddenly exclaim that she’d entirely forgotten dinner; she made a cup of coffee at 4 p.m. so she could wait, then another at 6, and now it’s 9:30.
From Nettie’s point of view, Viv’s investigations could benefit from a better application of the scientific method, and she’s happy to teach it. Because her position keeps her out of the lab, she jumps at chances to answer Viv’s questions, particularly if it gives her a chance to look at specimens or do some actual science. Nettie knows a lot about a particular field of science and a little about the rest. Consider assigning her a specialty and having her use her authority as chair to know the rest — by chance, she was just talking with Dr. McIntyre about the very thing Viv mentions, and can supply the broad outlines easily.""" ;

Whether deciding to focus on sculpting or join the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, she’s passionate about it — until she isn’t. Despite her apparent religious frivolity, she never discards books the way she does beliefs and can be called upon for theological as well as occult questions. At night, her heavy kohl makeup, bangles, and robe-like dresses quickly identify her as an acolyte with aspirations. By day, she works as a low-level draftswoman in her father’s architectural firm. In return, her father funds summer-long artists’ retreats and tolerates her forays into occultism. He’s waiting for her to give up her wild streak and put her obvious talent to use in the family trade. If you catch her in the studio, she’s likely got paint, iron filings, or plaster in her tousled brown curls, depending on her current “period.”
Viv fell for Stella during an undercover investigation of a drug-smuggling ring passing itself off as a yogic sect. Even after their fling ended, Vivian stayed close with the vivacious bohemian, who will happily expound on current and former passions, or on architecture if she must. Stella’s ebullient personality doesn’t lend itself to limiting the flow of information, but her earnest, schoolchild’s manner when explaining Mythos matters means that hearing about Cthulhu’s eventual rise doesn’t scare Viv as much as it might, coming from someone else.""" ;

Others maintain that nurses employ it on the more troublesome occupants of their wards. One brokendown panhandler outside the Herald Tribune’s building claims to be “the only man to have survived the bottle,” entreating the journalists to buy him a drink for his story. He hints at dark bargains made at the founding of the city, and ulterior motives for the hospital’s generous mandate." ;

In 1892, gold magnate Lewis L. Bradbury engaged the firm of architect Sumner Hunt to construct a building inspired by the 1887 science-fiction novel Looking Backward. It described the perfect utopia of the year 2000. At the last minute, Bradbury took an inexplicable shine to Hunt’s inexperienced draftsman George Wyman and asked him to take the lead on the project. An uncertain Wyman affixed a pencil to an Ouija planchette and consulted his dead brother, who wrote a note urging him to accept the assignment. The building was then constructed in gorgeous Renaissance revival style, though its beauty cost Bradbury his very life force — he dropped dead before its completion. A monument to Euclidean order, it helps to counter and drain the insane energies of the Mythos gods who have taken up increasing residence in the minds of city inhabitants. By the late 30s, frayed around the edges, the building is mostly occupied by fabric wholesalers." ;

Dex has a choice of sticking around and witnessing the explosion’s aftermath, or shadowing the presumed bombers in his car.
He sees Bing Crosby come rushing out of the casino, along with many others, to see what’s happened. He groans in horror to see that it was his car that got blown up. Whitey and Burl flank him, grabbing him as his knees give out. Dex hears Whitey tell him “This wasn’t aimed at you, Mr. Crosby.

On the advice of ley-obsessed Harry Chandler, zoning rules prohibit any other building from exceeding its height. Architects modeled its neoclassical lines on the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, built in honor of the 4th Century BCE Hellenistic Persian satrap Mausolus by his sister and widow Artemesia. The two rulers built their city from nearly nothing and absorbed vast quantities of wealth in doing so. Such was the splendor of Artemesia’s structure that her husband-brother became the namesake for monuments to the dead. By sympathetically evoking their spirits, City Hall grants its occupants subliminal occult power to arrogate resources from the citizenry and win approval for their development projects. It shares this influence with the chief Masonic temple in the nation’s capital." ;

Intentionally or not, he reestablished that link during his post-election funk, causing the quake. Frightened by the result, Shuler has yet to attempt it again. But if his righteous wrath gets out of control again, he might shake the city to its foundations. The one man in Shuler’s organization who heard him confess to this has just washed up dead on Venice Beach, and Dex has been hired to find out why." .

If Viv stops to listen to the men talk, she learns that, the last few days, Fuller has asked one or two men to show him their skills. He must have high standards, however, as those men haven’t come back.
Apart from a tidy desk in the front, the inside of Fuller’s reflects its warehouse origins.

Most don’t look up, but one or two glance her way.

Returning to New York, he found night work and studied Art History and Archaeology at Columbia College. Now he hangs out his shingle as guide for amateur archaeological expeditions, which he leads to places such as Egypt, China, Peru, and the American Southwest.
Between treks, Esteban provides curatorial guidance at the American Museum of Natural History. There, he specializes in pre-Columbian artifacts of Western, Central, and South America. With his free time, Esteban hikes the Long Trail in Vermont or blazes segments of New York’s newlyproposed Long Path toward Albany. A man can never get too much fresh air, sunshine, or exercise.
Esteban met Viv several years ago on an expedition he led for the National Geographic Society — he came for the archaeology, Viv for the story. They developed the friendship of kindred spirits who choose a never-ending quest for adventure over white picket fences or dinners at six-thirty sharp. When in the city, he enjoys dining out with Viv to share stories of their latest exploits. He’s happy to hazard the cultural history of a peculiar idol she’s discovered, or identify a strange set of tracks.""" ;

                   sche:description """In 1800, William Herschel discovered the first known light beyond our visible spectrum: infrared. What if there were far more that the human eye couldn’t see? What if ghosts and other strange or spectral phenomena really existed, but at wavelengths just on the edge of human perception? What if mediums and the spiritually sensitive simply have sharper visual and aural acuity than the rest of the population? Hoping to answer these questions, electrician and amateur inventor George Preston built a “sympathetic resonator” which emits frequencies altering the wavelengths of light and sound. On the moonless night of (Wednesday) May 1st, 1935, he threw the switch.
Unfortunately, Preston’s invention worked too well. Rather than manipulate the edges of human perception, it exposed dimensions which overlap with our own — and exposed those within its influence to the creatures of that dimension. In his darkened room, Preston remained out of sight. Others in the building did not fare so well. A scream from his neighbor’s apartment brought Preston out of his reverie, but he switched off the machine too late. One man lay half-eaten, others fought to retain their stability. No one could explain the appearance of the hideous apparitions or their sudden disappearance — or no one chose to.
Stricken with guilt, Preston vowed to end it in the only way he felt he deserved — offering himself up to those same beasts in a grotesque penance. Unable to enlist the aid of his closest friend, Charlie Fitzpatrick, he called on his employer, Howard Fuller, to witness his death and destroy the infernal device (Thursday). From the shadows of the machine shop’s upper-floor office, Fuller observed his employee’s gruesome demise. But the lure of profit, albeit with a thin veneer of patriotism, stopped him from destroying the machine.
Fuller believes recent news of Germany’s rearmament can only lead to one thing. But he could be the man who saves America and makes a mint from the Department of War, if only he can recover the plans. Fuller removes the schematics from Preston’s workbench and locks them in the safe in his office. However, what he retrieves only shows part of the device. If Fuller wants to sell this device, he’ll have to reverse-engineer the rest or get his hands on the complete schematics.
Of course, Preston’s disappearance has not gone unnoticed. Police find its timing suspicious, considering the mysterious death that occurred in his building the day before. His fiancée, Sadie Cain, refuses to believe George had anything to do with it and enlists Viv’s aid in finding him and proving his innocence.
Another group seeks Preston as well, or at least his plans. Madame Isis Neferi (Bertha Cook), medium and leader of the Temple of Nephthys, might have started out as a charlatan, but the earnest young inventor with his talk of spirits, spectrums, and enhancing human perception sparked her interest. If his machine works, her profession will change forever. And if she gets her hands on the first model?""" ;

I write as an admirer of your work. Though by trade an electrician, I consider myself an inventor in the tradition of Marconi, Morse, and Bell. For several years now, I have worked on a device, which I consider a successor to the radio and the television. Just as we walk daily through waves from a dozen radio stations and now television stations as well, so I believe we are constantly surrounded by the unseen spirits who exist at a frequency most humans cannot perceive. From my readings on psychic phenomena, I conclude that mediums are no different from others who possess such acute hearing that they cannot live in a house with others or such a strong sense of taste that they only eat the blandest of foods. And we average men are like the color-blind who cannot distinguish red from green, only our numbers are far greater. Machines, unlike men, face no such limitations. When complete, my device will amplify light and sound to make visible that which exists at the very edge of what you and I can see and hear.
From your books, I gather that you possess a greater openness to scientific proof of psychic phenomena than many others in your line of work. I would be deeply indebted if you would be willing to discuss my theory with me further and attend the first public unveiling of the device, which I now believe to be in its final stages.
I have recently begun attending psychic ceremonies at the Temple of Nephthys. From my observation, I believe the medium, Madame Isis, possesses a true connection to the spirit world. Unlike others whose séances I have attended, she does not elicit phantasmal raps, conjure glowing hands, or move objects with ghostly fingers as a magician might. Several of her regular attenders with whom I have spoken, including her secretary, attest to the veracity of statements they receive from the departed. I consider such testimonies better proof than showy phenomena. Despite my faith in my own observations, I hope I might ask whether you had visited her on one of your investigations and, if so, whether you observed any fraudulent behavior of the types you describe in your books.
I remain yours sincerely, George Preston.""" ;

Once he realized the insufficiency of his genius, he focused on something only slightly easier to achieve: making his business a success. He hires only the best, keeps them working from eight to six, and guarantees repaired items “as good as new or your money back.”
The window of Fuller’s office gives him a full view of the goings-on below. A set of large switches above duplicates those on the floor below, each with a surname written on tape under them. Viv may learn, or deduce, that these control the power to an electrician’s desk in case of electrocution. A microphone and switch on Fuller’s desk allow him to broadcast to the electricians downstairs. Fuller varies his posture between overlooking his domain, arms akimbo, and smoking a pipe with his feet on the desk.
When she enters the room, Fuller assumes Viv has come with a concern or to find out whether his shop could take an unusual repair job. Before she can get out her first question, he boasts about the quality of work his men provide and assures her that, no matter how big or small, they’ll have it back to her in a week or her money back. “Fuller [chuckle] quality than your everyday repairman. Tell a friend, save 15% on your next repair!”
Whether or not he respects Viv’s work as an investigative journalist, Howard Fuller respects the power of the press.
Despite the best efforts of Petunia Adams, Fuller litters his desk with letters, receipts, invoices, and newspapers. Viv notices an opened envelope addressed to George Preston, with “Personal” written across the top in a neat hand.""" ;

Margaret unlocks the door to her sister’s room to let Dex in. She and Helen’s nurse, an alert, collected, young, black woman named Ella Perreau, remain in the room, ready to intervene at any moment.
The room has been stripped of almost all furniture and ornament. Its adjoining bathroom has no mirror, no scissors, no nail files — nothing Helen could use to hurt herself.
Helen sits on the edge of a bed, wearing a clean new housecoat Ella has wrapped her in for the occasion. When the robe falls open, revealing a modest lace nightdress, Margaret steps in to fold it closed again. Helen’s hair, still wet from recent shampooing, hangs in a disordered mess. She stares straight ahead, moving her lips as if mumbling, but making no sound.
Mostly this scene establishes the severity of the psychic crime committed against Helen. Dex does not have to gather any information from it in order to move forward. Helen remains unresponsive to most questions.""" ;

Six years later, in a paranoid, drunken rage, Griffith shot Christina in the head, costing her the use of her right eye. After a divorce and brief stint in San Quentin, Griffith made a second Christmas present to the city: funds to build a Greek theater in the park.
Griffith died in 1919, leaving behind a will calling for the construction of an observatory to bring astronomical knowledge to the urban masses. The Griffith Observatory opened four years ago, in 1933. Visitors most remark upon its prominently displayed, deco-styled Foucault’s pendulum, a device demonstrating the Earth’s rotation.
Legend attributes a rash of misfortunes and untimely deaths in the park to Doña Petrenilla, a ghostly young woman in a white 19th-century dress who patrols it on misty nights. She’s been sore ever since, in true Los Angeles fashion, someone cheated her out of this land in an inheritance grift. Some say that when Griffith J. Griffith shot his wife, he thought he was aiming at Petrenilla.
A beacon shines from a tower in the park. At night, should he find himself groggily returning to consciousness in the northern part of the city sprawl, your Investigator can use its light to orient himself.
Sightings of green, man-like beings in the park suggest it also contains an outlet for a subterranean ghoul corridor.""" ;

Between 1910 and 1930, the demographics of Harlem shifted from around 10% black to 70%. Despite the shift, much of the area, including cultural centers, remained owned by white landlords and only began integrating (or didn’t) in the ’30s.
In 1935, Harlem experienced what historians call “the first modern race riot” (perhaps forgetting the 1921 white race riot in Tulsa which destroyed the city’s “Black Wall Street” and led to nearly 40 deaths). Rumors of a shoplifter being beaten to death by a white shopkeeper unleashed barely contained tensions, and a day of rioting ended with three dead. La Guardia appointed a multiracial committee to investigate the incident. The only surprising part of the committee’s report was its honest assessment of the situation — the black residents of Harlem face nearly 50% unemployment and find themselves the last in line for any jobs that do open up. They chafe under segregation and suffer police brutality. The riot appeared to have been purely spontaneous, with understandable causes that the city would do well to address before it happens again.""" ;

Hughes and his passenger said he was sober and driving slowly, and that the man walked in front of him. A witness said otherwise, but completely reversed the story in time for the coroner’s inquest. Early in 1937 Hughes broke the transcontinental airspeed record in his Hughes H1 Racer, a plane he helped to build. He makes passes at every actress he works with, some of them successful. At present he registers as merely driven and ambitious, like nearly everyone at the top of the L.A. heap. Sure, maybe he’s got this weird thing about sorting his peas by size before eating them.

Rising Masseria lieutenant Charles “Lucky” Luciano, 40, (1897–1962) switched sides in 1931, assuring the victory of Salvatore Maranzano. After receiving the Masseria empire as a reward, Luciano sent a squad of Jewish and Italian hit men to take out Maranzano, thus eliminating both sides in the fight.
Unlike the older Mafiosi who cared deeply about Sicilian blood and total control, Luciano immigrated young and belongs to a generation of broad-minded American crime bosses. He sees the benefits of collaborating for profit and in employing talented outsiders from the Irish and Jewish mobs, as well as non-Sicilian Italians.
In the new Commission, the heads of the Five Families may be equal, but Luciano is a little more equal than the rest. His droopy eye and various facial scars testify to the multiple beatings and attempted assassinations, including a throatcutting, he survived even before becoming the most powerful crime boss in New York City. In 1936, the law caught up to Luciano in the form of a pandering charge. Special Prosecutor Thomas Dewey raided brothels connected to the family. He finds three workers willing to testify about Luciano’s direct involvement in the business. Considering the number of interests Luciano controlled by this point, the entire affair came off as shady, but the jury convicted anyway. After losing appeals, Luciano went upstate. When WWII breaks out, he will lend some covert assistance to the Allies and get early release on the condition he return to Italy. Although he will spend several years in Cuba, Lucky will never re-enter the United States or regain control of his organization.""" ;

               sche:description """In the Roaring Twenties, New York City roared loudest. Jazz Age nightclubs flourished, Wall Street boomed, and it seemed that the city, like its newest wave of architecture, had nowhere to go but up. The political machine, Tammany Hall, loathed Prohibition, allowing bootleggers to operate virtually unchallenged — in exchange for a fee. Unafraid of the corrupt cops, gangs slaughtered each other in the streets, each trying to get the biggest piece of the market. But as long as the booze flowed freely, revelers overlooked its bloody cost.
Then it all went bust.
At first, the city tried to pretend nothing had really changed. Just two weeks after the crash, they re-elected Tammany mayor Jimmy Walker, a fast-living playboy, hoping that if they closed their eyes it’d all go back to the way things were. Wall Street bankers echoed the president’s reassurances — prosperity was just around the corner. But bank after bank closed, Wall Street fought against any kind of regulation, and, unable to sell their goods, factories shuttered. By early 1932 the city (and country) approached an unemployment rate of 25%.
Even as jobs vanished, the city’s population poised to hit the seven million mark in the 1930s, nearly half of that immigrants or first-generation Americans. Many of those who stepped off the boat under Lady Liberty’s gaze simply remained, packing into tenements, working in the city’s many factories, and bringing with them millenniaold cults and myths from their homelands. Each square mile houses an average of 23,000 people. “Hoovervilles,” constructed of cardboard, scrap metal, and anything squatters could get their hands on, spring up in the city’s parks and open stretches like the waterfront. Residents fight evictions with sandbags and barbed wire.
Under the New Deal, the city attempts to put its people to work, constructing a series of improvements — to transit, infrastructure, and housing. Modern project housing aimed at working families replaces tenements and slums, leaving the poorest nowhere to go. The Lincoln Tunnel, constructed from 1934 to 1937, pipes commuter traffic from New Jersey directly into Midtown. Private industry throws its money behind construction as well, racing to build the tallest skyscraper in the world and constructing hybrid cultural-business complexes such as the Rockefeller Center.
Yet inside these gleaming new buildings, the Big Apple still runs rotten to the core. The Mafia grows more powerful than ever under the guidance of Lucky Luciano and the city’s Five Families. Fusion party mayor Fiorello La Guardia finds himself fighting the mob on one side and the entrenched Tammany Hall on the other, or sometimes the two together. In an effort to uproot Tammany, the mayor consolidates power in his own office and agencies, gradually turning authoritarian as he begins targeting establishments which offend his own scruples.
This is the New York of breadlines, the New York of gangland shootings, the New York turned vertical by skyscrapers, the New York in which shadowy, trench-coated figures dodge streetlights. This is 1937 in the city that never sleeps.
During the 1930s, the Sicilian mob, or Cosa Nostra, transforms from a bunch of families and independent gangs smuggling booze into a wellorganized post-Prohibition racket. Though Federal authorities scoff at the idea of any serious criminal organization, those in New York City feel the effect of the local Five Families. The Mafia worms its way into enterprises at all ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, from the waterfronts and the unions (and non-union shops) which it holds in a tight fist to lavish hotels and restaurants which factor protection money into their cost of doing business.
Luciano proposes the creation of the Commission, in which seven Italian families from New York, Buffalo, and Chicago form a board of directors to guarantee peace. The New York contingent consists of what become known as the “Five Families:” the Luciano, Bonanno, Gambino, Profaci, and Gagliano families. With Prohibition about to end, the families used the capital and organizational skills they’d developed in bootlegging to get into a dozen other criminal rackets. Their racketeering includes playing both sides of unions, running numbers games, charging protection money, and “investing” in everything from dockside enterprise to classy restaurants.
One advantage the Commission offers its families is a decentralized arm which conducts its hits with plausible deniability. Dubbed Murder Incorporated by reporter Harry Feeney, the outfit fits its weapon to the task, using everything from machine guns to ice picks. Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel, Jewish mobsters and associates of Luciano, receive credit for conceiving the organization, which may have sprung from their Prohibition-era gang.
Working side by side, the Five Families drove out or subsumed the city’s Jewish and Irish mobs, who’d often rivaled them during Prohibition. Some, like Lansky and Siegel, found themselves working closely with the Italian mob — kept out of the inner sanctum, but still trusted with large operations.""" ;

In a turn that will not surprise anyone who has read this far, the restoration of Hispanic history entailed the wholesale displacement of its current immigrant residents. Chandler, eager to get his geomantic fingerprints all over this numinous region of the city, supported the plan at a crucial moment by picking up the phone to Police Chief Two Gun Davis. He rounded up the prison labor necessary to fix up a key structure, the 1818 Avila Adobe, saving it from condemnation and getting his foot in the redevelopment door. That was in 1930. The preservationists got their tourist trap Mexican-themed marketplace, Chandler hooked it into his ley-line grid, and residents had to find new homes in the Chavez Ravine. Noticing a Chinese neighborhood across the street, Chandler fretted that its geomancers would use feng shui techniques to divert his hard-won ley force, so he, Sterling, and Chandler decided to put a train station there. In 1937, Union Station is still a construction site; it will open in ’39." ;

Until he either succeeds at that or realizes that he has no chance of success, he naturally omits all mentions of ghouls or the Mythos. He might admit that the weird rock Siegel was toying with came from a cavern beneath his place, and invite Dex to explore it.
Roy might also twig to the fact that Dex will feel compelled to see what’s down in his basement, and tell him more than that.
The elevator-like cage resembles a medievalstyle cage gibbet, but with a solid floor. It is suspended on a chain attached to an automated winch mechanism. Should Roy convince Dex to step into the elevator-like cage, he slams the door closed and snaps shut its bolt lock mechanism. Though it can be opened from the inside, this takes time, giving Roy time to do the following: he walks over to Burl, sees that he has finally expired, and severs one of his hands with a hacksaw; then he tosses the hand through the cage bars, spattering Dex with Burl’s blood.
The scene then unfolds much like “In the Ghoul Cage”, but with much of Roy’s confession already provided. Now he adds the Mythos-related dope as he hops up and down in glee, anticipating the arrival of the ghouls.
If Roy can’t maneuver an unwilling Dex into the cage, our hero likely still wants to see what’s down there, but on his own terms. Dex can step into the cage — without locking it, natch — and then reach out to hit its big push button.""" ;

Viv’s visitor is a fragile, waif-like girl. Sadie Cain speaks in the soft, defensive tone of someone who has gone through her story several times already. She’s cried too long to have any tears left. Instead, her eyes reflect a quiet blankness.
Sadie’s fiancé, George Preston, disappeared three days ago under mysterious circumstances. She thinks the police are framing him for a murder, just like those articles Viv wrote about police frame-ups a few years ago. She wants Viv to find him and to prove him innocent.

Siegel and Cohen might enjoy the rough stuff, but he’d rather buy his way out of trouble than have to dirty his hands digging makeshift graves. He apologizes for his employee’s overeagerness. “We’ve had a number of break-ins lately. Though I think it’s just kids looking to pinch fitness magazines.”
When discussing his affairs Budd couches his statements as if he’s in the magazine business: “In periodical distribution, sometimes you got to be a little tough on the competitors, see?”
A bit of a dandy, he cut his teeth on confidence schemes and floating gambling games in Pittsburgh. When that town got too hot for him, he threw in with Lansky, Frank Costello, and their new protégé, Benjamin Siegel.
If the conversation goes hideously wrong, Budd decides words won’t suffice and orders his guys to deliver a decisive beating. That, he thinks, is how you shut up a nosy private dick.""" ;

He will call on those old allegiances one last time in 1939, negotiating the surrender of mob hit man Lepke Buchalter to his new pal J. Edgar Hoover. Viv can find him at Table 50 of Manhattan’s Stork Club, where he holds court and broadcasts his show.
